# Pokéapi Python API Code

This is a simple Pokémon-themed game in Python which uses the [Pokéapi](https://pokeapi.co/).

There will soon be two versions of this code. There is currently game.py, which is a text-based version of the game. Eventually there will be a GUI version with sprites and buttons using Tkinter.

## Gotta Cache 'Em All!

As the [Pokéapi documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docsv2/) says, please try to cache the resources and images if they are requested in the code. My code makes this very easy to do.
